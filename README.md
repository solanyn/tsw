# A Taylor Swift Study

Does Taylor Swift always sing about the same thing? Do her songs always have the same motifs?  

In this repository, we share findings and methodologies of Taylor Swift lyrics from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective.  

We look at the [Corpus of Taylor Swift](https://github.com/sagesolar/Corpus-of-Taylor-Swift) for an awesome cleaned dataset.
